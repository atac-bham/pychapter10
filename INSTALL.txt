Installing the library:
	
	1. Install Python 2.5 or greater from http://python.org/download
	2. Open a command prompt (terminal or console on *nix systems)
	3. "cd" (change directory) to the directory this file is in
	4. As an administrator ("sudo" on *nix) run the command "setup.py install"
		if this doesn't work try adding "python" to the beginning.
	5. You can now import the library as "chapter10" or run any of the utility
		scripts straight from the commandline
		
Running the tests:
	
	The tests depend on "samples/MSN001R1.ch10" existing.

	From the project directory run "runtests.py" or
		"python runtests.py" to run the included test suite.
