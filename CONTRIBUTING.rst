Questions or Comments
---------------------

Commits, issues, and pull requests can all host comments & discussion to better
coordinate efforts. Constructive discussion is always welcome.

Code Standards
--------------

Adhere to relevant code style & testing constraints. For Python refer to
PEP8_. Automated tools are available for the various editors to autorun style
checking, etc.

Issues
------

To report bugs or suggest features, create an issue. Issues are the "to do"
list for repos and allow for triage of priorities and clarity of development
focus.

Pull Requests
-------------

When working on an issue (see above), the workflow should be as follows:

1. Create a branch named issue-# (ie. issue-4)
2. Make the edits needed to resolve the issue
3. Commit the changes and push the issue branch to a personal fork or the main
   repo
4. Create a pull request from the uploaded branch into the master branch
5. Once reviewed the pull request will be merged into the master branch

When working on a feature involving several commits, though not tied to an
issue, use the same workflow, but name the branch "<featurename>" (ie. docopt)

Also viable, make changes on a personal fork of the repo and submit a PR from
there.
